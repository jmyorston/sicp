# SICP
This repo is an attempt to worth through the problems and excercises in SICP to understand more about programming.

I havent figured out how to format in vscode, but this works as a workaround:
```bash
raco fmt --width 30 sqrrt.rkt > temp.rkt && mv temp.rkt sqrrt.rkt
```
and to run the procedures
```bash
racket sqrrt.rkt
```

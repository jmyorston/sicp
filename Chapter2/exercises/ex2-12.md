# Exercise 2.12: 

Define a constructor `make-center-percent` that takes a center and a percentage tolerance and produces the desired interval. 
You must also define a selector percent that produces the percentage tolerance for a given interval. 

The center selector is the same as the one shown above.

```scheme
(define (make-center-percent center percent)
  'your-answer-here)
 
(define (percent interval)
  'your-answer-here)

```

## Answer
```scheme
(define (make-center-percent c p)
  (let ((w (* c p)))
    (make-center-width c w)))

(define (percent i)
  (/ (width i) (center i)))
```

# Exercise 2.28:

Write a procedure fringe that takes as argument a tree (represented as a list) and returns a list whose elements are all the leaves of the tree arranged in left-to-right order. 

For example:

```scheme
(define x (list (list 1 2) (list 3 4)))
(fringe x)
(1 2 3 4)
(fringe (list x x))
(1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4)
```

## Answer

```scheme
(displayln "*** Exercise 2.28 ***")

(define (leaf? item)
  (not (pair? item)))

(define (fringe x)
  (cond ((null? x) null)
        ((leaf? x)(list x))
        (else (append (fringe (car x))(fringe (cdr x))))))
 
(define lst (list (list 1 2) (list 3 4)))
(fringe lst)
; (1 2 3 4)
(fringe (list lst lst))
; (1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4)
(define complex-list
  '((1 2) (3) () (4 (5) 6) 7 (8)))

(fringe complex-list)
```

# Exercise 2.2
Consider the problem of representing line segments in a plane. Each segment is represented as a pair of points: a starting point and an ending point. 

Define a constructor `make-segment` and selectors `start-segment` and `end-segment` that define the representation of segments in terms of **points**. 

Furthermore, a **point** can be represented as a pair of numbers: the $x$ coordinate and the $y$ coordinate. Accordingly, specify a constructor `make-point` and selectors `x-point` and `y-point` that define this representation.

Finally, using your selectors and constructors, define a procedure `midpoint-segment` that takes a line segment as argument and returns its midpoint (the point whose coordinates are the `average` of the coordinates of the endpoints). 

To try your procedures, you'll need a way to print points:
```scheme
(define (print-point p)
  (display "(")
  (display (x-point p))
  (display ",")
  (display (y-point p))
  (display ")")
  (newline))
```

### Answer
```scheme
#lang racket

(define (print-point p)
  (display "(")
  (display (x-point p))
  (display ",")
  (display (y-point p))
  (display ")")
  (newline))

(define (print-segment s)
  (display "(")
  (display (start-segment s))
  (display ",")
  (display (end-segment s))
  (display ")")
  (newline))

; points
(define (make-point x y)
  (cons x y))

(define (x-point x)
  (car x))

(define (y-point y)
  (cdr y))


; segments
(define (start-segment x)
  (car x))

(define (end-segment x)
  (cdr x))

(define (make-segment x y)
  (cons x y))

(define (average x y)(/ (+ x y) 2))

(define (midpoint-segment x)
  (make-point(average (x-point (start-segment x)) (x-point (end-segment x)))
             (average (y-point (start-segment x)) (y-point (end-segment x)))))

; testing
(define point1 (make-point 4 2))

(define point2 (make-point 6 4))

(define seg1 (make-segment point1 point2))

(print-point point1) ; (4,2)
(print-segment seg1) ; ((4 . 2),(6 . 4))
(print-point (midpoint-segment seg1)) ; (5,3)

```

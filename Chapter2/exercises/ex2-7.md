# Exercise 2.7
Alyssaâ€™s program is incomplete because she has not specified the implementation of the interval abstraction. Here is a definition of the interval constructor:

```scheme
(define (make-interval a b) (cons a b))
```

Define selectors upper-bound and lower-bound to complete the implementation.

### Answer
```scheme
(define (lower-bound x)
  (min (cdr x) (car x)))


(define (upper-bound x)
  (max (cdr x) (car x)))

; you can also have a more generic function e.g.
(define (bound f x)
  (f (cdr x) (car x)))

(displayln (bound max interval))

```

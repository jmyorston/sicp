# Exercise 2.21: 
The procedure `square-list` takes a list of numbers as argument and returns a list of the squares of those numbers.

```scheme
(square-list (list 1 2 3 4))
(1 4 9 16)
```

Here are two different definitions of `square-list`. Complete both of them by filling in the missing expressions:

```scheme
(define (square-list items)
  (if (null? items)
      nil
      (cons <??> <??>)))

(define (square-list-map items)
  (map <??> <??>))

```

## Answer 
```scheme
; sq helper
(define (sq x)
  (* x x))

(define (square-list items)
  (if (null? items)
      '()
      (cons (sq (car items))
            (square-list (cdr items)))))

(square-list '(1 2 3 4))

; '(1 4 9 16)

(define (square-list-map items)
  (map sq items))

(square-list-map '(1 2 3 4))

; '(1 4 9 16)

```

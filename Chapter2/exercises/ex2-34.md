# Exercise 2.34:

Evaluating a polynomial in $x$ at a given value of $x$ can be formulated as an accumulation. We evaluate the polynomial

$$a_nr^n+a_{n−1}r^{n−1}+⋯+a_1r+a_0$$

using a well-known algorithm called `Horner's rule` , which structures the computation as

$$(⋯(a_nr+a_{n−1})r+⋯+a_1)r+a_0$$

In other words, we start with $a_n$ , multiply by $x$ , add $a_{n−1}$, multiply by $x$, and so on, until we reach $a_0.$

Fill in the following template to produce a procedure that evaluates a polynomial using Horner's rule. Assume that the coefficients of the polynomial are arranged in a sequence, from $a_0$ through $a_n$.

```scheme
(define (horner-eval x coefficient-sequence)
  (accumulate (lambda (this-coeff higher-terms) )
              0
              coefficient-sequence))
```

For example, to compute $$1+3x+5x^3+x^5$$ at $x=2$ you would evaluate:

```scheme
(horner-eval 2 (list 1 3 0 5 0 1))
```

## Answer

```scheme
(displayln "*** Exercise 2.34 ***")

(define (horner-eval x coefficient-sequence)
  (accumulate (λ (this-coeff higher-terms)(+ (* x higher-terms) this-coeff))
              0
              coefficient-sequence))

(horner-eval 2 (list 1 3 0 5 0 1))
```

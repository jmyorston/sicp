# Exercise 2.5
Show that we can represent pairs of non-negative integers using only numbers and arithmetic operations if we represent the pair `a` and `b` as the integer that is the product $2^{a}3^{b}$. 
Give the corresponding definitions of the procedures `cons`, `car`, and `cdr`.

```scheme
(define (expt x y)
  (if (= y 0)
      1
      (* x (expt x (- y 1)))))


(define (cons a b)
  (* (expt a 2)(expt 3 b)))

; helper for recursive division 
; (divide n by x until no remainder)
(define (extract n x)
  (if (= (remainder n x) 0)
      (+ 1 (extract (/ n x) x))
      0))

; divide by 2 recursively until the remainder is 0
(define (car x)
  (extract x 2))

; divide by 3 recursively until the remainder is 0
(define (cdr x)
  (extract x 3))


(define z (cons 2 3))

(displayln z)
; 108
(displayln (car z))
; 2
(displayln (cdr z))
; 3
```

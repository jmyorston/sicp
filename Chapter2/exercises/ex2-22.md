# Exercise 2.22: 
Louis Reasoner tries to rewrite the first square-list procedure of Exercise [2-21](ex2-21.md) so that it evolves an iterative process:

```scheme
(define (square-list items)
  (define (iter things answer)
    (if (null? things)
        answer
        (iter (cdr things)
              (cons (square (car things))
                    answer))))
  (iter items nil))

```
Unfortunately, defining `square-list` this way produces the answer list in the reverse order of the one desired. Why?

Louis then tries to fix his bug by interchanging the arguments to cons:

```scheme
(define (square-list items)
  (define (iter things answer)
    (if (null? things)
        answer
        (iter (cdr things)
              (cons answer
                    (square (car things))))))
  (iter items nil))
 ``` 

This doesn't work either. Explain.

## Answer
- the first procedure doenst work as its adding each number to the beging of an existing list
- the second prodecure causes problems because the cdr of a list, should always be a list - and so you get a "dotted list"

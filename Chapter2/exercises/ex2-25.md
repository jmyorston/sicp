# Exercise 2.25:

Give combinations of `cars` and `cdrs` that will pick `7` from each of the following lists.
Represent the list as `l`.

```scheme
(1 3 (5 7) 9)

((7))

(1 (2 (3 (4 (5 (6 7))))))
```

## Answer

```scheme
(define l1 '(1 3 (5 7) 9))

(define l2 '((7)))

(define l3 '(1 (2 (3 (4 (5 (6 7)))))))

; Step by step for l1
(cdr l1)
; (3 (5 7) 9)
(cdr (cdr l1))
; ((5 7) 9)
(car (cdr (cdr l1)))
; ((5 7))
(cdr (car (cdr (cdr l1))))
; (7)
(car (cdr (car (cdr (cdr l1)))))
; 7

; l2
(car (car l2))
; 7

; l3
(car (cdr (car (cdr (car (cdr (car (cdr (car (cdr (car (cdr l3))))))))))))
; 7

```

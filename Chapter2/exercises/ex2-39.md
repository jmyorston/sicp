# Exercise 2.39:

Complete the following definitions of `reverse` ([Exercise 2-18](ex2-18.md)) in terms of `fold-right` and `fold-left` from [Exercise 2-38](./ex2-38.md):

```scheme
(define (reverse sequence)
  (fold-right (lambda (x y) <??>) nil sequence))

(define (reverse sequence)
  (fold-left (lambda (x y) <??>) nil sequence))
```

## Answer

<details>

```scheme
(define (reverse sequence)
  (fold-right (lambda (x y) (append y (list x))) nil sequence))

(reverse (list 1 2 3))

(define (reverse sequence)
  (fold-left (lambda (x y) (cons y x)) nil sequence))

(reverse (list 1 2 3))

```

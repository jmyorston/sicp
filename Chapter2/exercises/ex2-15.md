# Exercise 2.15: 
Eva Lu Ator, another user, has also noticed the different intervals computed by different but algebraically equivalent expressions. She says that a formula to compute with intervals using Alyssa's system will produce tighter error bounds if it can be written in such a form that no variable that represents an uncertain number is repeated. Thus, she says, `par2` is a "better" program for parallel resistances than `par1`. Is she right? Why?

## Answer

Alright, let's recall the problem of computing the parallel resistances using Alyssa's interval system.

Two resistors $R_1$ and $R_2$ in parallel have a combined resistance $R_{parallel}$ given by the formula:

$$ \frac{1}{R_{parallel}} = \frac{1}{R_1} + \frac{1}{R_2} $$

Thus:

$$ R_{parallel} = \frac{R_1 \times R_2}{R_1 + R_2} $$

Now let's look at the two possible implementations:

1. **par1**:
$$ R_{parallel} = \frac{1}{\frac{1}{R_1} + \frac{1}{R_2}} $$

2. **par2**:
$$ R_{parallel} = \frac{R_1 \times R_2}{R_1 + R_2} $$

If we consider $ R_1 $ and $ R_2 $ as intervals, then in **par1** the intervals $ R_1 $ and $ R_2 $ are each used twice: once in the denominator of a fraction and once in the sum of those fractions. This repeated use can compound the error in the resulting interval.

On the other hand, **par2** multiplies $R_1$ and $R_2$ once and adds them once, thus limiting the potential for error inflation.

To see why this matters, let's consider how errors propagate in interval arithmetic. Let's say we have an interval $x $ with a small error. 

If we use $ x $ twice in an arithmetic operation, the error gets added twice. This results in a broader range (or a larger width) for the resultant interval. So, repeating an interval with uncertainty in a calculation can lead to a less precise result, i.e., an interval with a larger width than necessary.

Therefore, Eva Lu Ator's observation is correct. The **par2** approach avoids the repeated use of uncertain intervals, and as such, it generally provides tighter error bounds.

# Exercise 2.3
Implement a representation for rectangles in a plane. (Hint: You may want to make use of [Exercise 2-2](ex2-2.md).) In terms of your constructors and selectors, create procedures that compute the perimeter and the area of a given rectangle. 

Now implement a different representation for rectangles. Can you design your system with suitable abstraction barriers, so that the same perimeter and area procedures will work using either representation?

```scheme
#lang racket

(define (print-point p)
  (display "(")
  (display (x-point p))
  (display ",")
  (display (y-point p))
  (display ")")
  (newline))

(define (print-segment s)
  (display "(")
  (display (start-segment s))
  (display ",")
  (display (end-segment s))
  (display ")")
  (newline))

; points
(define (make-point x y)
  (cons x y))

(define (x-point x)
  (car x))

(define (y-point y)
  (cdr y))


; segments
(define (start-segment x)
  (car x))

(define (end-segment x)
  (cdr x))

(define (make-segment x y)
  (cons x y))

(define (average x y)(/ (+ x y) 2))

(define (midpoint-segment x)
  (make-point(average (x-point (start-segment x)) (x-point (end-segment x)))
             (average (y-point (start-segment x)) (y-point (end-segment x)))))


; make rectangle
; Representation 1: (cons (bottom-left point) (top-right point)) 
(define (make-rect blp trp)
  (list blp
        ; top left
        (make-point (x-point blp) (y-point trp))
        ; bottom right
        (make-point (x-point trp) (y-point blp))
        ; top right
        trp))


(define (width-rect r)
  (- (x-point (third r)) (x-point (first r))))

(define (height-rect r)
  (- (y-point (second r)) (y-point (first r)))) 

(define (area-rect r)
  (* (width-rect r) (height-rect r)))

(define (perim-rect r)
  (* (+ (width-rect r) (height-rect r)) 2))


; testing
; define rect
(define r1 (make-rect (make-point 1 1) (make-point 4 2)))

(displayln (perim-rect r1))

(displayln (area-rect r1))

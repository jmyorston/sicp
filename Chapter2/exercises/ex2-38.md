# Exercise 2.38:

The `accumulate` procedure is also known as `fold-right`, because it combines the first element of the sequence with the result of combining all the elements to the right. There is also a `fold-left`, which is similar to `fold-right`, except that it combines elements working in the opposite direction:

```scheme
(define (fold-left op initial sequence)
  (define (iter result rest)
    (if (null? rest)
        result
        (iter (op result (car rest))
              (cdr rest))))
  (iter initial sequence))
```

What are the values of:

```scheme
(fold-right / 1 (list 1 2 3))

(fold-left / 1 (list 1 2 3)) ;please give the inverse, we haven't implemented rational numbers yet!

(fold-right list nil (list 1 2 3))

(fold-left list nil (list 1 2 3))
```

Give a property that `op` should satisfy to guarantee that `fold-right` and `fold-left` will produce the same values for any sequence.

## Answer

```scheme
(fold-right / 1 (list 1 2 3))
 ; '(/ 1 (/ 2 (/ 3 1)))
 ; '(/ 1 (/ 2 3))
 ; '(/ 1 (0.6666))
 ; 1.5

(fold-left / 1 (list 1 2 3)) ; please give the inverse, we haven't implemented rational numbers yet!
 ; '(/ (/ (/ 1 1) 2) 3)
 ; '(/ (/ 1 2) 3)
 ; '(/ 0.5 3)

(fold-right list nil (list 1 2 3))
 ; '(list 1 (list 2 (list 3 (list nill))))
 ; '(1 (2 (3 ())))

(fold-left list nil (list 1 2 3))
 ; '((((list 1) list 2) list 3) list nill)
 ; '(((() 1) 2) 3)


; Operation should have associative property
; (op (op a b) c) === (op a (op b c))
; For example + or *
; (output (fold-right + 0 (list 1 2 3)))
; (output (fold-left + 0 (list 1 2 3)))

; (output (fold-right * 1 (list 1 2 3)))
; (output (fold-left * 1 (list 1 2 3)))
```

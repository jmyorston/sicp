# Exercise 2.14
Demonstrate that Lem is right. Investigate the behavior of the system on a variety of arithmetic expressions. 

Make some intervals A and B, and use them in computing the expressions A/A and A/B. You will get the most insight by using intervals whose width is a small percentage of the center value. Examine the results of the computation in center-percent form (see [Exercise 2.12](./ex2-12.md)).

## Answer
To investigate this we can create intervals $A$ and $B$ and compute $\frac{A}{A}$ and $\frac{A}{B}$ According to our standard arithmetic rules, we'd expect $\frac{A}{A} = 1$. 
However, due to the nature of interval arithmetic, this might not always be the case.

Using the following we can see:

```scheme
(displayln "Excercise 2.14")
(define A (make-center-percent 100 0.05)) ; 100 +/- 5% which is [95, 105]
(define B (make-center-percent 150 0.03)) ; 150 +/- 3% which is [145.5, 154.5]

; Compute A/A and A/B
(define result-AA (div-interval A A))
(define result-AB (div-interval A B))

; Display the results in center-percent form
(display "A/A in center-percent form: ")
(display (center result-AA))
(display " +/- ")
(display (* 100 (percent result-AA)))
(displayln "%")

(display "A/B in center-percent form: ")
(display (center result-AB))
(display " +/- ")
(display (* 100 (percent result-AB)))
(displayln "%")

 ; Excercise 2.14
 ; A/A in center-percent form: 1.0050125313283207 +/- 9.97506234413964%
 ; A/B in center-percent form: 0.6682681079638342 +/- 7.988017973040436%

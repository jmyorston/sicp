# Exercise 2.16: 
Explain, in general, why equivalent algebraic expressions may lead to different answers. Can you devise an interval-arithmetic package that does not have this shortcoming, or is this task impossible? (Warning: This problem is very difficult.)

## Answer
I think I'll come back to this one sometime ðŸ˜†

But any package will inevitably be a compromise between accuracy, complexity and ease of use.

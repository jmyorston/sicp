# Exercise 2.9
The width of an interval is half of the difference between its upper and lower bounds. The width is a measure of the uncertainty of the number specified by the interval.

For some arithmetic operations the width of the result of combining two intervals is a function only of the widths of the argument intervals, whereas for others the width of the combination is not a function of the widths of the argument intervals. 

Show that the width of the sum (or difference) of two intervals is a function only of the widths of the intervals being added (or subtracted). 

Give examples to show that this is not true for multiplication or division.

## Answer
The width of an interval can be defined as:

$w(I) = \frac{b-a}{2}$

which is the same as:
```scheme
(define (width-interval x)
  (/ (- (bound max x)(bound min x)) 2))
```
#### Aum
To prove the sum of two intervals, we can define two intervals as:

$X = [a, b]$

$Y = [c, d]$

therefore the sum of the two intervals:

$X + Y = [a + c, b + d]$

And the width of the sum is:

$w(X + Y) = \frac{(b+d)-(a+c)}{2}$

This is equal to:

$w(X - Y) = \frac{b-a}{2}+ \frac{d-c}{2} = w(X) + w(Y)$

#### Multiplication or division

if $X = [2 ,4]$ then $w(X) = 1$

if $Y = [3,5]$ then $w(Y) = 1$

multiplying the two intervals togethger gives us another interval - 

$X*Y = [6, 20]$

$w(X * Y) = \frac{20-6}{2} = 7$

$7 \neq w(X) + w(Y)$

We can define these as functions:
```scheme
 (define (add-interval x y)
  (make-interval (+ (bound min x) (bound min y))
                 (+ (bound max x) (bound max y))))

(define (mult-interval x y)
  (let ((p1 (* (bound min x)(bound min y)))
        (p2 (* (bound min x)(bound max y)))
        (p3 (* (bound max x)(bound min y)))
        (p4 (* (bound max x)(bound max y))))
    (make-interval (min p1 p2 p3 p4) (max p1 p2 p3 p4))))

(displayln (add-interval (make-interval 2 4)(make-interval 3 5)))
 ; (5 . 9)

(displayln (mult-interval (make-interval 2 4)(make-interval 3 5)))
 ; (6 . 20)

```

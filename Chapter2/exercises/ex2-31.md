# Exercise 2.31: 
Abstract your answer to Exercise [2-30](./ex2-30.md) to produce a procedure `tree-map` with the property that `square-tree` could be defined as

```scheme
(define (square-tree tree) 
    (tree-map square tree))

```

## Answer
```scheme
(displayln "*** Exercise 2.31 ***")

(define (square-tree-map tree)
  (tree-map sq tree))

(define (tree-map f t)
  (cond ((null? t) '())
        ((pair? t)(cons (tree-map f (car t))
                        (tree-map f (cdr t))))
        (else (f t))))
                   

(square-tree-map  (list 1
                        (list 2 (list 3 4) 5)
                        (list 6 7)))

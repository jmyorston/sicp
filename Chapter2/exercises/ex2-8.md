# Exercise 2.8
Using reasoning analogous to Alyssaâ€™s, describe how the difference of two intervals may be computed. Define a corresponding subtraction procedure, called `sub-interval`.

### Answer
The minimum value is the smallest possible value of the first minus the largest of the second and represents the lower-bound.

The maximum would be the largest of the first minus the smallest of the second, which represents the upper-bound of the new interval.

```scheme
(define (make-interval a b) (cons a b))

(define (lower-bound x)
  (min (cdr x) (car x)))


(define (upper-bound x)
  (max (cdr x) (car x)))

(define (bound f x)
  (f (cdr x) (car x)))

(define (sub-interval x y)
  (make-interval (- (bound max x) (bound min y))
                 (- (bound min x) (bound max y))))
```

# Exercise 2.10
Ben Bitdiddle, an expert systems programmer, looks over Alyssa's shoulder and comments that it is not clear what it means to divide by an interval that spans (includes) zero. 

```scheme
(define (div-interval x y)
  (mul-interval x
                (make-interval (/ 1.0 (upper-bound y))
                               (/ 1.0 (lower-bound y)))))
```

Modify Alyssa's code to check for this condition and to signal an error if it occurs.

## Answer
We can use a helper function `zero-check` to check for 0 bounds and return an error and then apply it to the `div-interval` procedure.
```scheme
(define (div-interval x y)
  (if (or (zero-check x) (xero-check y))
      (error "division by zero")
      (func-interval * x
                     (make-interval (/ 1.0 (upper-bound y))
                                    (/ 1.0 (lower-bound y))))))

(define (zero-check x)
  (and (< (lower-bound x) 0) (> (upper-bound x) 0)))
```

# Exercise 2.33:

Fill in the missing expressions to complete the following definitions of some basic list-manipulation operations as accumulations:

```scheme
(define (map p sequence)
  (accumulate
            (lambda (x y) (cons (p x) y)) nil sequence))

(define (append seq1 seq2)
  (accumulate cons <??> <??>))

(define (length sequence)
  (accumulate <??> 0 sequence))

```

## Answer

```scheme
(displayln "*** Exercise 2.33 ***")

(define (map p sequence)
  (accumulate
   (lambda (x y) (cons (p x) y))
   null
   sequence))

(map square (list 1 2 3 4 5))
; '(1 4 9 16 25)

(define (append seq1 seq2)
  (accumulate cons seq1 seq2))

(append (list 1 2 3) (list 4 5 6))
'(4 5 6 1 2 3)

(define (length sequence)
  (accumulate (Î» (x y)(+ 1 y)) 0 sequence))

(length (list 1 4 19 100 3425 100 300))
; 7
```

# Question 1.6
Alyssa P. Hacker doesn’t see why if needs to be provided as a special form. “Why can’t I just define it as an ordinary procedure in terms of cond?” she asks. Alyssa’s friend Eva Lu Ator claims this can indeed be done, and she defines a new version of if:

``` scheme
#lang racket
; Alyssa's new-if procedure
(define (new-if predicate then-clause else-clause)
  cond
  (predicate then-clause)
  (else else-clause))


(define (sqrt-iter guess x)
  (new-if (good-enough? guess x)
          guess
          (sqrt-iter (improve guess x) x)))
; Recursive function that iteratively improves the guess
; until it reaches a "good enough" approximation of the
; square root of 'x'.

(define (good-enough? guess x)
  (< (abs (- (square guess) x)) 0.001))
; Checks if the guess is "good enough" by comparing
; the absolute difference between the square of the guess
; and 'x' with a threshold value of 0.001.

(define (improve guess x)
  (average guess (/ x guess)))
; Improves the current guess by taking the average of
; the guess and the division of 'x' by the guess.

(define (average x y)
  (/ (+ x y) 2))
; Calculates the average of two numbers 'x' and 'y'.
; This is then used in the helper function 'improve'

(define (sqrt x)
  (sqrt-iter 1.0 x))
; Initializes the first guess as 1.0 and calls the
; sqrt-iter function to start the iterative process
; of improving the guess.

(define (square x)
  (* x x))
; Calculates the square of a number 'x'.

(sqrt 12)
; Calculates the square root of 9 using the sqrt function.

```

# Answer
_the issue when running the code is that it runs recursively, this is because of the the `new-if` function.
'Applicative order' means that the `then-clause` and `else-clause` are executed before the `predicate` in the `cond` is evaluated.
This eager evaluation of the arguments of the `cond` happens regardless of whether the predicate is true or false._

**applicative-order** evaluation prioritizes evaluating arguments and resolving internal calculations before executing the main function. This approach helps ensure that all necessary computations are completed before moving forward.

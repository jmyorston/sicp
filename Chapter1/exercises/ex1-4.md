Observe that our model of evaluation allows for combinations whose operators are compound expres- sions. Use this observation to describe the behavior of the following procedure:

```scheme
(define (a-plus-abs-b a b)
        ((if (> b 0) + -) a b))
```
if b is greater than 0, then the operand for a b is addition, if b is negative then its subtration.
e.g.

```scheme
(define (a-plus-abs-b a b)
        ((if (> b 0) + -) a b))

(a-plus-abs-b 3 5)
; this will result in 8
(a-plus-abs-b 3 -5)
; this will result in 8
; due to the double negative as b is less than 0, so the operand returns - and then 3 - -5 is equal to 3+5

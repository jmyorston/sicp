# Exercise 1.43
If $f$ is a numerical function and $n$ is a positive integer, then we can form the $n\th$ repeated application of $f$, which is defined to be the function whose value at $x$ is $f(f(⋯(f(x))⋯))$. 

For example, if $f$ is the function $x↦x+1$, then the nth repeated application of $f$ is the function $x↦x+n$. If $f$ is the operation of squaring a number, then the nth repeated application of $f$ is the function that raises its argument to the $2^{n}th$ power. 

Write a procedure that takes as inputs a procedure that computes $f$ and a positive integer $n$ and returns the procedure that computes the $nth$ repeated application of $f$.
Your procedure should be able to be used as follows:

```scheme
((repeated square 2) 5)
; 625
```

## Answer
The procedure uses recursion to apply $f n$ times to the input $x$,
```scheme
(define (square x)
  (* x x))


(define (repeated f n)
  (λ(x)
    (if (= n 1)
        (f x)
        (f ((repeated f (- n 1)) x)))))

((repeated square 2) 5)
; 625
```

Using compose from [ex 1.42](./ex1-42.md)
```scheme

(define (square x)
  (* x x))

(define (compose f g)
  (λ(x)
    (f (g x))))

(define (repeated f n)
  (if (= n 1)
      f
      (compose f (repeated f (- n 1))))) 

((repeated square 2) 5)
; 625
```

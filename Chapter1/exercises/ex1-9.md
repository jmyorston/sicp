# Excercise 1.9
Each of the following two procedures defines a method for adding two positive integers in terms of the procedures inc, which increments its argument by 1, and dec, which decrements its argument by 1.

```scheme
(define (+ a b)
  (if (= a 0)
      b
      (inc (+ (dec a) b))))

(define (+ a b)
  (if (= a 0)
      b
      (+ (dec a) (inc b))))
```

Using the substitution model, illustrate the process generated by each procedure in evaluating (+ 4 5). Are these processes iterative or recursive?

```scheme
(+ 4 5)
(inc (+ (dec 4) 5))
(inc (inc (+ (dec 3) 5)))
(inc (inc (inc (+ (dec 2) 5))))
(inc (inc (inc (inc (+ (dec 1) 5)))))
(inc (inc (inc (inc 5))))
(inc (inc (inc 6)))
(inc (inc 7))
(inc 8)
9

; the first procedure is recursive

(+ 4 5)
(+ (dec 4)(inc 5))
(+ (dec 3)(inc 6))
(+ (dec 2)(inc 7))
(+ (dec 1)(inc 8))
9

; the second procedure is linear
```

> The easiest way to spot that the first process is recursive (without writing out the substitution) is to note that the "+" procedure calls itself at the end while nested in another expression; the second calls itself, but as the top expression.

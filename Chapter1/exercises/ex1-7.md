# Exercise 1.7
The good-enough? test used in computing square roots will not be very effective for finding the square roots of very small numbers. 
Also, in real computers, arithmetic operations are almost always performed with limited precision. This makes our test inadequate for very large numbers. Explain these statements, with examples showing how the test fails for small and large numbers. An alternative strategy for implementing good-enough? is to watch how guess changes from one iteration to the next and to stop when the change is a very small fraction of the guess. Design a square-root procedure that uses this kind of end test. Does this work better for small and large numbers?

# Answer
In the code below, I created a new procedure `gooder-enough` this procedure will evaluate the difference between the current guess and the next guess and if the difference is less than 0.1% then it returns true.

If the number is very small or very large, adjusting our guess by a fixed amount each time could either overshoot the answer or take too long to get there. But if we adjust our guess by a fraction of the current guess, the adjustment is scaled appropriately no matter how large or small the number is - we handle this fractional adjustment using `(* accuracy guess)`.

When comparing the output of the two procedures with a small input, the new strategy produces increased accuracy.

### Output
```console

0.0583836557198196

Square root approximation using gooder-enough?:
0.05514369711714174

Actual value is:

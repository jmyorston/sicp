# Exercise 1.29
Simpson's Rule is a more accurate method of numerical integration than the method illustrated above. Using Simpson's Rule, the integral of a function $f$ between $a$ and $b$ is approximated as:

$$
\frac{h}{3} \left[y_0 + 4y_1 + 2y_2 + 4y_3 + 2y_4 + \ldots + 2y_{n-2} + 4y_{n-1} + y_n\right]
$$

where $h = b - a$, for some even integer $n$, and $y_k = f(a + kh)$. Increasing $n$ increases the accuracy of the approximation.

Define a procedure that takes as arguments $f$, $a$, $b$, and $n$ and returns the value of the integral, computed using Simpson's Rule. Use your procedure to integrate `cube` between 0 and 1 (with $n = 100$ and $n = 1000$), and compare the results to those of the `integral` procedure shown above.

```scheme
#lang racket

(define (simpson f a b n)
  (define h (/ (- b a) n))
  (define (y k) (f (+ a (* k h))))
  (define (term k)
    (cond
      ((= k 0)(y 0))
      ((= k n)(y n))
      ((even? k)(* 2 (y k)))
      (else (* 4 (y k)))))
  (* (/ h 3)
     (sum term 0 inc n)))


(define (integral f a b dx)
  (define (add-dx x) (+ x dx))
  (* (sum f (+ a (/ dx 2.0)) add-dx b)
     dx))

(define (cube n)
  (* n n n))

(define (sum term a next b)
  (if (> a b)
      0
      (+ (term a) (sum term (next a) next b))))


(define (inc n)
  (+ n 1))

# Exercise 1.24
Modify the `timed-prime-test` procedure of exercise 1.22 to use `fast-prime?` (the Fermat method), and test each of the 12 primes you found in that exercise. 

Since the Fermat test has $Θ(log\space n)$
growth, how would you expect the time to test primes near 1,000,000 to compare with the time needed to test primes near 1000? Do your data bear this out? Can you explain any discrepancy you find?

### Answer:
As the numbers increase from around 1,000 to around 1,000,000, the time taken only doubles. This is because we only need to do the square root of a thousand (which is around 31.6) times more checks, so the time taken only increases by that factor.

Let $T$ be the running time of the procedure, and $n$ the prime tested. 

We have:

$T \propto \sqrt{n}$

$T$ is proportional to the square root of $n$

Taking logarithm base $\sqrt{n}$ on both sides, we have:

$\log_{\sqrt{n}}(T) \propto \frac{\log_{\sqrt{n}}(n)}{2}$

This suggests that if $n$ increases by a factor of $k$, the running time $T$ will increase by a factor of $\sqrt{k}$:

$\frac{T_2}{T_1} = \sqrt{\frac{n_2}{n_1}}$

where $T_1$ and $T_2$ are the running times for testing primes $n_1$ and $n_2$ respectively. This shows the logarithmic relationship between the sizes of the primes ($n$) and the running times ($T$).

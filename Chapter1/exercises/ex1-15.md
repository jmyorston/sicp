# Exercise 1.15 
The sine of an angle (specified in radians) can be computed by making use of the approximation $sin\space x ≈ x$ if $x$ is sufficiently small, and the trigonometric identity

$$sin\space x = 3 \space sin \space \frac{x} {3} - 4\space sin\space {x^3} \frac{x} {3}$$


to reduce the size of the argument of sin. (For purposes of this exercise an angle is considered “sufficiently small” if its magnitude is not greater than 0.1 radians.) These ideas are incorporated in the following procedures:

```scheme
(define (cube x) (* x x x))
(define (p x)    (- (* 3 x) (* 4 (cube x))))
(define (sine angle)
  (if (not (> (abs angle) 0.1))
      angle
      (p (sine (/ angle 3.0)))))
```
**a. How many times is the procedure `p` applied when `(sine 12.15)` is evaluated?**

- The function `p` is evaluated 5x
    - this is because `(sine 12.15)` needs to be evaluated 6x until the angle is less than 0.1, at this point the function `p` unwinds.
    - `sine` is called one more time than `p` because `sine` has to make a recursive call before it can call `p`, and the initial call to sine is not paired with a call to `p`. 

**b. What is the order of growth in space and number of steps (as a function of $a$) used by the process generated by the sine procedure when $(sin\space a)$ is evaluated?**
- The order of growth is logarithmic - $O(log(a))$ - the number of steps is proportional to the number of times $O$ is divisible by 3 until it is $> 0.1$, the number of times p executes is $a-1$ so it does not add overhead when the recursion unwinds.

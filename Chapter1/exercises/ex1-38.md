# Exercise 1.38
n 1737, the Swiss mathematician Leonhard Euler published a memoir _De Fractionibus Continuis_, which included a continued fraction expansion for $e−2$, where $e$ is the base of the natural logarithms. In this fraction, the $N_i$ are all 1, and the $D_i$ are successively $1, 2, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 6, 1, 1, 8, ….$ Write a program that uses your `cont-frac` procedure from Exercise 1.37 to approximate $e$, based on Euler’s expansion.

```scheme
#lang racket


(define (cont-frac-itr n d k)
  (define (iter i nextTerm)
    (let ((currentTerm (/ (n i) (+ (d i) nextTerm))))
      (if (= i 1)
          currentTerm
          (iter (- i 1) currentTerm))))
  (iter k 0))


(define (euler k)
  (define (n i) 1.0)
  (define (d i)
    (if (= (remainder i 3) 2)
        (* (+ (quotient i 3) 1) 2)
        1))
  (cont-frac-itr n d k))

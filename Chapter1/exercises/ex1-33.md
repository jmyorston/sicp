# Exercise 1.33
You can obtain an even more general version of `accumulate` [(exercise 1.32)](./ex1-32.md) by introducing the notion of a filter on the terms to be combined. That is, combine only those terms derived from values in the range that satisfy a specified condition. 
The resulting `filtered-accumulate` abstraction takes the same arguments as `accumulate`, together with an additional predicate of one argument that specifies the filter. Write `filtered-accumulate` as a procedure.

### Recursive
```scheme
(define (accumulate include-a? combiner null-value term a next b)
  (if (> a b)
      null-value
      (if (include-a? a)
          (combiner (term a) (accumulate include-a? combiner null-value term (next a) next b))
          (accumulate include-a? combiner null-value term (next a) next b))))

(define (inc x)(+ x 1))

(define (even x)
  (= (remainder x 2) 0))
              
; sum
(define (sum-acc-even term a next b)
  (accumulate even + 0 term a next b))

; sum of even numbers squared between 2 and 5
(displayln (sum-acc-even (lambda (x) (* x x)) 2 inc 5))

```

### Iterative
```scheme
#lang racket

(define (acc-iter include-a? combiner null-value term a next b)
  (define (iter a result)
    (if (> a b)
        result
        (if (include-a? a)
            (iter (next a) (combiner result (term a)))
            (iter (next a) result))))
  (iter a null-value))

(define (inc x)(+ x 1))

(define (even x)
  (= (remainder x 2) 0))
              
; sum
(define (sum-acc-even term a next b)
  (acc-iter even + 0 term a next b))

; sum of even numbers squared between 2 and 5
(displayln (sum-acc-even (lambda (x) (* x x)) 2 inc 5))
```

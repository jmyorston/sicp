# Exercise 1.39
A continued fraction representation of the tangent function was published in 1770 by the German mathematician J.H. Lambert:
$$tan(x) = \frac{x}{{1 - \frac{x^2}{{3 - \frac{x^2}{{5 - \ldots}}}}}}$$

where $x$ is in radians. 

Define a procedure `(tan-cf x k)` that computes an approximation to the tangent function based on Lambertâ€™s formula. $k$ specifies the number of terms to compute, as in [Exercise 1.37](./ex1-37.md).

## Answer

```scheme
#lang racket

(define (cont-frac-itr n d k)
  (define (iter i nextTerm)
    (let ((currentTerm (/ (n i) (+ (d i) nextTerm))))
      (if (= i 1)
          currentTerm
          (iter (- i 1) currentTerm))))
  (iter k 0))


(define (tan-cf x k)  
  (define (n i)
    (if (= i 1) x (- (* x x))))
  (define (d i)
    (- (* i 2) 1))
  (cont-frac-itr n d k))

(tan-cf 0.5 1)
(tan-cf 0.5 2)
(tan-cf 0.5 4)
(tan-cf 0.5 8)

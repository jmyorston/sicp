# Exercise 1.25
Alyssa P. Hacker complains that we went to a lot of extra work in writing `expmod`. After all, she says, since we already know how to compute exponentials, we could have simply written

```scheme
(define (expmod base exp m)
  (remainder (fast-expt base exp) m))

```

Is she correct? Would this procedure serve as well for our fast prime tester? Explain.

# answer
no - using this procedure impacts performance significantly, this is because the modified version of `expmod` computes large intermediate results before reducing these which introduces significant overheads.

# Exercise 1.20: 
The process that a procedure generates is of course dependent on the rules used by the interpreter.

As an example, consider the iterative gcd procedure given above. Suppose we were to interpret this procedure using normal-order evaluation, as discussed in Section 1.1.5. (The normal-order-evaluation rule for if is described in Exercise 1.5.) Using the substitution method (for normal order), illustrate the process generated in evaluating `(gcd 206 40)` and indicate the remainder operations that are actually performed. 

```scheme
(define (gcd a b)
  (if (= b 0)
      a
      (gcd b (remainder a b))))
```

- How many remainder operations are actually performed in the evaluation of `(gcd 206 40)`?

### Normal Order Evaluation
- expand and contract method
```scheme

    (r (r 206 40) (r 40 (r 206 40)))

    ; 4*r
    2
```
- 18 operands of `remainder` (or `r` in the example above are performed.


### Applicative Order Evaluation
```scheme
    (gcd 206 40) ; b = 40
;   (remainder 206 40) evaluates to 6
        (gcd 40 6) ; b = 6
;       (remainder 40 6) evaluates to 4
            (gcd 6 4) ; b = 4
;           (remainder 6 4) evaluates to 2
                (gcd 4 2) ; b = 2
;               (remainder 4 2) evaluates to 0
                    (gcd 2 0) ; b = 0
    
; b = 0, there fore a=2 and `remainder` is not called.
```
- 4 operands of `remainder` are performed

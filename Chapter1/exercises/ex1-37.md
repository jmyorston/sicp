# Exercise 1.37
An infinite continued fraction is an expression of the form:

$$f = N_1 + \cfrac{D_1}{{N_2 + \cfrac{D_2}{{N_3 + \cfrac{D_3}{{\ddots}}}}}}$$

As an example, one can show that the infinite continued fraction expansion with the $N_i$ and the $D_i$ all equal to 1 produces $\frac{1}{\varphi}$, where $\varphi$ is the golden ratio (described in 1.2.2). One way to approximate an infinite continued fraction is to truncate the expansion after a given number of terms. Such a truncation, a so-called finite continued fraction $k$-term finite continued fraction, has the form:
$$N_1 + \cfrac{D_1}{{N_2 + \cfrac{D_2}{{\ddots + \cfrac{D_k}{{N_k}}}}}}$$

Suppose that $n$ and $d$ are procedures of one argument (the term index $i$) that return the $N_i$ and $D_i$ of the terms of the continued fraction. Define a procedure `cont-frac` such that evaluating `(cont-frac n d k)` computes the value of the $k$-term finite continued fraction. Check your procedure by approximating $\frac{1}{\varphi}$ using:

```scheme 

(cont-frac (lambda (i) 1.0)
           (lambda (i) 1.0)
           k)
```

for successive values of $k$. How large must you make $k$ in order to get an approximation that is accurate to 4 decimal places?

If your `cont-frac` procedure generates a recursive process, write one that generates an iterative process. If it generates an iterative process, write one that generates a recursive process.

### Iterative solution
```scheme

(define (cont-frac-itr n d k)
  (define (iter i nextTerm)
    (let ((currentTerm (/ (n i) (+ (d i) nextTerm))))
      (if (= i 1)
          currentTerm
          (iter (- i 1) currentTerm))))
  (iter k 0))

```

### Recursive solution
```scheme

(define (cont-frac-recur n d k)
  (define (recur i)
    (let ((currentTerm (/ (n i) (+ (d i)))))
      (if (= k i)
          currentTerm
          (/ (n i) (+ (d i) (recur (+ 1 i)))))))
  (recur 1))

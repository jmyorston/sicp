# Exercise 1.42
Let $f$ and $g$ be two one-argument functions. The $composition f$ after $g$ is defined to be the function $x \mapsto f(g(x))$. Define a procedure compose that implements composition.
For example, if `inc` is a procedure that adds 1 to its argument:
```scheme
((compose square inc) 6)
;49
```
---
## Answer
```scheme
#lang racket

(define (inc x)(+ x 1))

(define (square x)
  (* x x))

(define (compose f g)
  (Î»(x)
    (f (g x))))

((compose square inc) 6)
;49
```

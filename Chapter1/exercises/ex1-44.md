# Exercise 1.44
The idea of smoothing a function is an important concept in signal processing. If $f$ is a function and $dx$ is some small number, then the smoothed version of $f$ is the function whose value at a point $x$ is the average of $f(x−dx)$, $f(x)$, and $f(x+dx)$. 

Write a procedure smooth that takes as input a procedure that computes $f$ and returns a procedure that computes the smoothed $f$.

It is sometimes valuable to repeatedly smooth a function (that is, smooth the smoothed function, and so on) to obtained the _n-fold smoothed function_. Show how to generate the _n-fold smoothed function_ of any given function using `smooth` and `repeated` from [exercise 1.43](ex1-43.md).

## Answer
`smooth` function
```scheme
(define (smooth f)
  (λ(x)
    (/ (+ (f (- x 0.001))
          (f x)
          (f (+ x 0.001)))
       3)))
```

### part 2
```scheme
(define (repeated f n)
  (if (= n 1)
      f
      (compose f (repeated f (- n 1)))))

(define (smooth f)
  (λ (x)
    (/ (+ (f (- x 0.001))
          (f x)
          (f (+ x 0.001)))
       3)))

(define (n-fold-smooth f n)
  (repeated smooth n))
```

# Exercise 1.35
Show that the golden ratio $φ$ (1.2.2) is a fixed point of the transformation $x↦1+1/x$, and use this fact to compute $φ$ by means of the `fixed-point` procedure.

### Answer

This is a second-order polynomial whose solution is:

$$ x= \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \equiv 1.6180 $$


```scheme
#lang racket

(define tolerance 0.00001)
(define (fixed-point f first-guess)
  (define (close-enough? v1 v2)
    (< (abs (- v1 v2)) tolerance))
  (define (try guess)
    (let ((next (f guess)))
      (if (close-enough? guess next)
          next
          (try next))))
  (try first-guess))


(display (fixed-point (lambda (x) (+ 1 (/ 1 x))) 1.0))

; 1.6180327868852458
